#### Goal
  > Explain concatenation with example

    Concatenate simply means to join together. JavaScrpt concatenation uses the plus '+', the comma',' sign and template literals to concatenate strings.

  **Example** :
  > let myInstructor = 'Ebenezer Don';

  > console.log('myInstructor' + ' is one of my favorite instructors ');
  
  > // Ebenezer Don is one of my favorite instructors
  
  String can also be concatenated using the comma',' symbol to but this does not require adding spaces into the string value or sentence.
  > let myInstructor = 'Ebenezer Don';

  > console.log('myInstructor' , 'is one of my favorite instructors')

  > // Ebenezer Don is one of my favorite instructors

  We will see in the latter example that there is not space seperation with the is one of my favorite instructors; but the former there is a space seperation, this an instance worth noticing.

  In JavaScript, We can insert or interpolate variables into strings using template literals
  We use the backtick symbol '`' , the dollar sign'$' and the curly braces '{}' .

  **Example**
  >let myAge = 25;
    
  > console.log (`I am ${myAge} years old`)
  > //I am 25 years old

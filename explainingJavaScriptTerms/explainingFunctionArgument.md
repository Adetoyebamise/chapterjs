#### Goal
> DIfference between function argument and parameter with example
    
    The value we supplied to our functions are called arguements.

    During a function definition the names that reprsent the values we intend to supply to the function are called parameters.
    
    During a function call, the actual value provided to the function are called arguments.

**Example**

> function sqaureNumber(numberRia){
>    return numberRia * numberRia;
> }
> console.log(sqaure(12));

In this case the argument is 12.

    #### Goal
    >DIfference between function argument and parameter with example
    function Parameters are name used to represent real values that are provided when a function is invoked. The parenthesis after the function name hold the function parameters.

    During a function definition the names that reprsent the values we intend to supply to the function are called parameters
    
    During a function call, the actual value provided to the function are called arguments

#### Assignment Objective
>Explain the Map and Reduce Methods with Examples
**Map Method**

- The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. 

- The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been mapped to a new form by the function.

**Reduce Method**

- Another common thing to do with arrays is to compute a single value from them. Our recurring example, summing a collection of numbers, is an instance of this. Another example is finding the script with the most characters.

- The higher-order operation that represents this pattern is called reduce (some-times also called fold).

- It builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element
from the array and combining it with the current value.

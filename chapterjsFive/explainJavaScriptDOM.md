#### Assignment Objective
>In a markown file, explain JavaScript DOM

DOM is short for Document Object MOdel, The DOM is an organization chart, created automatically by the browser when your web page loads, for the whole web page. All the things on the your web page - the tags, the text blocks, the images, the links, the tables, the style attributes, and more - have spots on this organization chart. This means that our JavaScript code can get its hands on anything on our web page, anything at all, just by saying where that things is on the chart.
